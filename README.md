# üèè IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Indian Premier League (IPL), uncovering trends, player stats, match insights, and team performances across all IPL seasons.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to explore and visualize IPL data in order to answer key questions:

* Which team has scored the most 200+ totals?
* Which team has the highest winning percentage?
* Who has won the most "Player of the Match" (MOM) awards?
* Is there a lucky venue for a particular team?

## üìä Data Sources

The analysis uses **two datasets**, which were merged using the `id` column to form a unified DataFrame:

* [Deliveries Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O6E5DBDSFYSK4D9kandO-ELgFV23GVyi/view?usp=sharing)
* [Match Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tfdKTH39s8bhpRbY_Sz5FYO6IRPoFoeG/view?usp=sharing)
