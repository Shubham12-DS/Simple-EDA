# IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üèè
This project contains an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) data. The analysis is performed to uncover interesting trends, player statistics, and match-level insights from all seasons of the tournament.

üéØ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to explore and visualize the IPL data to answer key questions, such as:

Which team has scored the most number of 200+ scores?

Which team has the highest winning percentage?

Who has won the most MOM awards?

Is there any lucky venue for a particular team?

üìä Data Sources
The analysis is based on two datasets containing information from the IPL matches. These two datasets were merged on a common id column to create a single, comprehensive DataFrame for analysis.
